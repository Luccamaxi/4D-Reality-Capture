# RealityCapture 4D Scene Processor

This project automates the processing of 4D scenes in **RealityCapture** using its CLI. It handles camera registrations, sequential frame injection, high-quality model processing with textures, and exports the results to an output folder. The processing can be **distributed across multiple machines** with a master node managing and monitoring all workers.

## Features
- **Automated RealityCapture Processing**: The program reads pre-registered camera data and injects image sequences frame-by-frame.
- **High-Quality Model Processing**: Runs RealityCapture with high settings and generates textures.
- **Distributed Processing Support**: Multiple worker nodes can run RealityCapture in parallel.
- **Master Node Monitoring**: A central dashboard tracks all worker nodes, displaying processing status and stats.
- **Networked Storage**: All RealityCapture project files must reside in a **networked folder** to enable seamless distributed processing.
- **Interchangeable Image Formats**: Works with multiple image formats for flexibility.

## Dependencies
- **RealityCapture**
- **Python** (I used 3.10)
- **A shared network folder** (required for distributed processing)

## Folder Structure
If you have different names make sure to reference them via relaive Paths see how with 

   ```sh
   python ./WebNode.py --help
   ```

   ```sh
   M:\
   â”‚â”€â”€ images\        # Folder containing multi image sequences
      |â”€â”€frame_0000\  # Folder containing camera images 
      ...
   â”‚â”€â”€ scene\         # Scene-related files
   â”‚â”€â”€ scene.rcproj   # RealityCapture project file
   â”‚â”€â”€ output\        # Folder for processed outputs
   ```

This keeps it readable and structured for your GitHub documentation. Let me know if you want any adjustments! ðŸš€

## Installation
Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realitycapture-4d-processor.git
   cd realitycapture-4d-processor
   ```
## Usage
- **Master Node**: Run the master script to manage distributed processing.
  ```sh
  python ./WebNode.py --server --root M:/ # REPLACE WITH YOUR NETWORK FOLDER
  ```
- **Worker Node**: Run the worker script on each processing machine.
  ```sh
  python ./WebNode.py --node -ip 192.168.178.22 -r M: # REPLACE WITH YOUR IP AND NETWORK FOLDER
  ```
